# bio111_project1
The code and data for students to get started with Project 1 data analysis.
These data come from the two sections of Bio111 from 2019.

Files:

The raw data 

Bio111 mutations 2019.tsv
Bio111 rpoB or not 2019.tsv

A file with code that you may want to use in developing your analysis, and a test data set to use with it:

calculate difference in mutations.Rmd
test_data.txt

The other files are only there if you are interested. They are the raw input data (in the form that the class put together) and the code that was used to transform that data into the more usable form above. We include it here in case you're interested in a typical example of using R for data wrangling.

# Bio111 Project1
The code and data for students to get started with Project 1 data analysis.
These data come from the two sections of Bio111 from 2019.

## The data

The two data files for this experiment are:

**Bio111 mutations 2019.tsv**

**Bio111 rpoB or not 2019.tsv**

Those files are the only ones that you absolutely need. However, you may also want code the following two files, which give you code you can use for your analysis and a test data set. 

**calculate difference in mutations.Rmd**

**test_data.txt**

## Data wrangling

The other files in this repo only need to be examined if you are interested. They are the raw input data (in the form that the class put together) and the code that was used to transform that data into the more usable form above. We include it here in case you're interested in a typical example of using R for data wrangling.

The two raw data files:

**Combined sequencing data - rpoB mutations.tsv**

**Combined sequencing data - rpoB or not.tsv**

The file with code for data wrangling is:

**compiling data for students.Rmd**

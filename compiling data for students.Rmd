This is the code I used to reformat data from files the 2019 class submited to the easier to use version we used for the analysis. It makes heavy use of the package `dplyr` and the pipe `%>%` from the package `magrittr`, both of which are part of the `tidyverse`. See chapters 5 and in [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/) for a great introduction. 

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(tidyverse)
library(readr)
```

```{r}
Combined_sequencing_data_rpoB_mutations <- read_delim("Combined sequencing data - rpoB mutations.tsv", 
    "\t", escape_double = FALSE, trim_ws = TRUE)

Combined_sequencing_data_rpoB_mutations %>% 
  rename(chaotic_label_antibiotic_concentration = antibiotic_concentration) %>%
  mutate(antibiotic_concentration = case_when(
    chaotic_label_antibiotic_concentration == "50" ~ "low",
    chaotic_label_antibiotic_concentration == "100" ~ "med",
    chaotic_label_antibiotic_concentration == "200" ~ "high",
    chaotic_label_antibiotic_concentration == "Low" ~ "low",
    chaotic_label_antibiotic_concentration == "Med" ~ "med",
    chaotic_label_antibiotic_concentration == "High" ~ "high",
   )
 ) %>%
  select(student, antibiotic_concentration, mutation) %>%
  write_tsv(path = "Bio111 mutations 2019.tsv")

```

```{r}
Combined_sequencing_data_rpoB_or_not <- read_delim("Combined sequencing data - rpoB or not.tsv", 
    "\t", escape_double = FALSE, trim_ws = TRUE)

Combined_sequencing_data_rpoB_or_not %>%
  group_by(`antibiotic conc`, `inside or outside`) %>%
  summarise(total = sum(`number of mutants`)) %>%
  write_tsv(path ="Bio111 rpoB or not 2019.tsv")
```
